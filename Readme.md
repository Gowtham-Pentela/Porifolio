# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio! Below are the key projects I've worked on, showcasing my experience in machine learning, data analysis, algorithms, and application development.

## Projects

### 1. [Sign Language Recognition](https://github.com/Gowtham-Pentela/Sign-Language-Recognition)
- **Description**: Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict American Sign Language (ASL) signs from images. This project involved data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, achieving an accuracy of 99.023%.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Keras, TensorFlow, Deep Learning
- **Timeline**: September 2024

### 2. [Diamonds Data Analysis](https://github.com/Gowtham-Pentela/R/tree/main/Diamonds)
- **Description**: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the diamonds dataset. The project focused on data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis to derive insights into diamond pricing and characteristics.
- **Technologies Used**: R, ggplot2, dplyr, Data Visualization
- **Timeline**: August 2024

### 3. [Efficient Path Finding and Visualization](https://github.com/Gowtham-Pentela/Algo_Course)
- **Description**: Implemented algorithms to find the shortest path between cities in the USA. The project included visualizations of the adjacency matrix, minimum spanning tree, and path-finding using the Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra's algorithms.
- **Technologies Used**: Java, Algorithms (Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra), javax.swing, Data Structures
- **Timeline**: August 2023 - September 2023
